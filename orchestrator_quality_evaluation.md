# Orchestrator Quality Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary
This evaluation analyzes research gap analysis reports generated by four AI orchestrators (AutoGen, LangGraph, OpenAI Swarm, and Strands) across three academic domains (Emergent Communication, Theorem Proving, Self-Improvement).

**Important Note**: AutoGen, LangGraph, and Strands all used identical models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) with identical prompts. Only OpenAI Swarm used a different model (GPT-5). We have only single runs per dataset, making statistical claims about orchestrator quality unjustified. The observed differences likely reflect:
- Random variation in LLM outputs
- Different token limits or context window management
- Implementation differences in how orchestrators handle the same prompts

## Objectively Verifiable Observations

### Report Length (Measurable)
- **AutoGen**: Longest reports (58-62KB)
- **LangGraph**: Long reports (61-77KB)
- **Strands**: Medium reports (27-39KB)
- **OpenAI Swarm**: Shortest reports (13KB consistently)

### Number of Research Directions (Countable)
- **AutoGen**: 10-11 directions per report
- **LangGraph**: 12 directions per report
- **Strands**: 8 directions per report
- **OpenAI Swarm**: 3 directions per report

### Model Differences
- **OpenAI Swarm** used GPT-5 (different model), which may explain its consistently shorter, less detailed outputs
- **All others** used Claude 3.5 Sonnet with identical prompts

## Content Examples from Reports

### Theorem Proving Dataset

**Report Lengths**:
- AutoGen: 58KB, 10 research directions
- LangGraph: 61KB, 12 research directions
- Strands: 30KB, 8 research directions
- OpenAI Swarm: 13KB, 3 research directions

### Self-Improvement Dataset

**Report Lengths**:
- AutoGen: 61KB, 10 research directions
- LangGraph: 62KB, 12 research directions
- Strands: 39KB, 8 research directions
- OpenAI Swarm: 13KB, 3 research directions

## Limitations of This Analysis

### Cannot Determine from Single Runs:
- Whether observed differences are due to orchestrator design or random variation
- Which orchestrator is "more creative" (would need multiple runs with statistical analysis)
- Whether one orchestrator is "better" than another when using the same model

### What We Can Conclude:
1. **OpenAI Swarm with GPT-5** consistently produces shorter reports (13KB) with fewer research directions (3) compared to Claude-based orchestrators
2. **Report lengths vary** even with identical models/prompts, suggesting different context management or token limits
3. **All Claude-based orchestrators** produced substantive reports with 8-12 research directions

## Recommendations

### For Reliable Evaluation:
- Run multiple trials per orchestrator/dataset combination
- Calculate statistical measures (mean, variance) of quality metrics
- Control for random seeds if possible
- Consider A/B testing with human evaluators

### Current Evidence Suggests:
- **OpenAI Swarm with GPT-5** produces briefer analyses (may be model-related rather than orchestrator-related)
- **AutoGen, LangGraph, and Strands** produce comparable outputs when using Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Differences in report structure may reflect orchestrator implementation details rather than quality

## Conclusion

Based on single runs, we cannot make justified claims about which orchestrator is "best" for creativity or usefulness. The observed differences between AutoGen, LangGraph, and Strands (all using identical Claude 3.5 Sonnet prompts) likely reflect:
- Random variation in LLM responses
- Different context window management strategies
- Implementation-specific token limits or processing

The only robust conclusion is that OpenAI Swarm with GPT-5 produces consistently shorter, less detailed reports than the Claude-based orchestrators, though this may be due to the model difference rather than the orchestrator itself.
